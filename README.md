# Cucumber 4 + Java 8 + Restful Webservices with SpringBoot 2 + SpringBootTest + Shared State

This is an example of how to configure cucumber 4 with multiple step classes running as SpringBootTest.

I wanted to register this one to make it easier.

## To Run the tests simply execute

`
$ ./gradlew clean build integrationTests
`
